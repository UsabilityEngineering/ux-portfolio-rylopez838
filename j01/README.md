# Experiencing with Hyundai Elantra 2019 Car Lock
Ever since I got my driving license I have been driving a 2018 [hyundai elantra](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.consumerreports.org%2Fcars%2Fhyundai%2Felantra%2F2018%2Foverview%2F&psig=AOvVaw0BWcJSzTm1wV7HuR8_lInp&ust=1668574430578000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCODi86yyr_sCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD). From the inside it is just like any other normal car. You have your AC buttons, your speaker knobs, as well as your door locks. That is what you expect to find in any traditoinal car.

It was August 12th of 2022 and school was 10 days away from starting which meant that I had to leave my hometown in a few days and drive for 11 hours to chico but there was only one problem. My car had [Sentri](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/what-is-sentri-pass-how-does-it-work) while my parents car did not had sentri. My parents started telling me that we should switch cars because they needed a car with sentri and since I was going to be far away from the border there was no point in me needing a car with sentri. The car that my parents were driving was a hyundai elantra as well but instead of 2018 it was 2019. Since my parents car was just one year newer from mine I thought that nothing was going to change from the inside just a couple of designs but nothing big in general so I told them that I was okay of switching the car with them.
