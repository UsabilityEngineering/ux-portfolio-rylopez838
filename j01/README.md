# First Journal Entry...
This is my first semester at Chico State University and I never had taken any computer science courses before. I was really unfamiliar with any type of software in general an for our CSCI 111 we had to donwload Ubuntu.


Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.With Ubuntu you are able to navigate, create, delete, rename, modify, and many other things. One of the most surprising things that I learned from Ubuntu was how to create, display the contents of a file, code, and compile a file.

At the beginning I did not had a satisfying and memorable experience with it since it was not userfriendly at all and that did not add for effectiveness to the user.
