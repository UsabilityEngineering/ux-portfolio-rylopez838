# Experiencing with Hyundai Elantra 2019 Car Lock
Ever since I got my driving license I have been driving a 2018 [hyundai elantra](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kbb.com%2Fhyundai%2Felantra%2F2018%2Fse-sedan-4d%2F&psig=AOvVaw3rbYwPxGEMIGsKhD4l1Mo1&ust=1668587061909000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCPD296_hr_sCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD). From the inside it is just like any other normal car. You have your AC buttons, your speaker knobs, as well as your door locks. That is what you expect to find in any traditoinal car.

It was August 12th of 2022 and school was 10 days away from starting which meant that I had to leave my hometown in a few days and drive for 11 hours to Chico but there was only one problem. My car had [Sentri](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/what-is-sentri-pass-how-does-it-work) while my parents car did not had sentri. My parents started telling me that we should switch cars because they needed a car with sentri and since I was going to be far away from the border there was no point in me needing a car with sentri. The car that my parents were driving was a hyundai elantra as well but instead of 2018 it was 2019. Since my parents car was just one year newer from mine I thought that nothing was going to change from the inside just a couple of designs but nothing big in general so I told them that I was okay of switching the car with them.

I drove the car for the whole trip (10 hours) and everything went smooth. I was lowering the volume of the music, raising the volume of the music, changing the temperature of the car, rolling down the windows, no ***inconvinience*** whatsoever. It was not until I got to Chico that I encounter a ***accessibility*** problem with the ***design*** of this car. I drove to my friends apartment because we were going to the store so I went to pick them up and when my friends tried getting into the car they were not able to open the door. I immediately put my left hand into the panel were the car door locks and window rollers are located to click on the door lock and unlock the car door but I was not able to locate it. I was getting so confused that I even thought that I was so burn out from the 10 hour drive non stop
